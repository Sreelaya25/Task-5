 Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

 Task Overview:
   
       This project was completed as part of a Data Analyst Internship (Task 5). The objective was to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset using Python and common data science libraries.

 Tools & Libraries Used:
 
     - Python
     - Pandas
     - Matplotlib
     - Seaborn
     - Google Colab

 What I Did:
 
     - Loaded and explored the Titanic training dataset (`train.csv`)
     - Identified and handled missing data (Age, Embarked)
     - Dropped columns with excessive null values (Cabin)
     - Performed univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis
     - Created visualizations: histograms, boxplots, countplots, heatmaps
     - Wrote detailed observations for each visual
     - Summarized key findings in a final summary section

 Key EDA Findings:
 
    - Females and first-class passengers had significantly higher survival rates
    - Fare and passenger class were strong indicators of survival
    - Age distribution showed that most passengers were between 20â€“40 years
    - Embarked port had some influence on survival (higher from Cherbourg)
    - Correlation heatmap revealed that Fare and Pclass correlated most with survival

 Files Included:
 
    - train.csv
    - test
    - gender_submission
    - EDA1 
    - README.md
